# Windows Unlock Using RFID
I am working on a RFID scanner that will automatically unlock my windows PC for once the RFID card is scanned. This will help me save time so that I do not have to enter my own password, but still the computer is safe.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was functionally getting my button configuration to work with my ESP32. An ESP32 is a micro controller similar to an Arduino that allows me to send signals and power to any parts necessary. This process allowed me to get familiar with working on ESP32 and using the button configuration to carry out a process. At first, I wired an LED light to the button and ESP32 using a breadboard, then focused on writing new code to send signals to my ESP32 using the button which would in turn send power to the LED light. Some issues I encountered in this process were wiring the button, ESP32, and LED/resistors all together. I had to first get familiar with the parts I was using and get a basic understanding of electrical engineering. I then had to learn basic code syntax to write my own code that would allow me to control the LED light using the button. Through the process, I had to learn about Loop statements, If else statements, Indexing, and using variables in my code. Afterwards, I was able to get my LED interacting with my button and ESP32. My next step was to get the ESP32 to interact with my PC’s keyboard via bluetooth. This would work by using the button to send a signal to my ESP32 to indicate when text would be written automatically on my computer. To do this I needed to download keyboard libraries to the ESP32 in order to format the code and connect my ESP32 to my computer via bluetooth in order for it to actually use the computer’s keyboard using the bluetooth function. A library is necessary to use the functionality of the bluetooth keyboard in the ESP32, this library was downloaded from a Github page. I then use my code from the LED and button configuration to adapt the code in order for the button to write text on my computer.
